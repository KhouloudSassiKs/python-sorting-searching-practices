# Python Practice: Recursion, Searching, and Sorting

This repository contains my **independent practice implementations** of classic algorithms in Python.  
The exercises are inspired by problems from **CodeSignal**, but all code here is my own work.

## 📌 Contents
- **Recursion**
  - Factorials
  - Recursive sum
  - Sum at even/odd indexes
- **Searching**
  - Linear search
  - Binary search
- **Sorting**
  - Bubble sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort

## 🚀 Goal
The purpose of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of:
- Recursive problem-solving
- Fundamental searching algorithms
- Sorting algorithms and their complexity
